# Scientific Calculator

This is a simple calculator project that I made because I've never seen a cauculator plugin that could do more complex calculations

# Instalation
- Note: It works ***ONLY*** on google chrome

1. Open the top-right dropdown menu on Chrome
2. Click "Extensions", then "Manage extensions"
3. On the top-right corner enable the developer mode
4. Then "Load Unpacked" and select the folder where the plugin files are in
